SpreeEditor
===========

# Summary #

This extension provides an inline rich-text editor for Spree. It implements different types of editors:

- [WYM Editor](http://www.wymeditor.org/)
- [TinyMCE](http://www.tinymce.com/)
- [YUI Rich Editor](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/editor/) (N.B. not currently available in Spree 0.70.x and newer)

# Installation #

1. Add the Spree Editor gem to your Gemfile:

    `gem 'spree_editor', :github => "spree/spree_editor"`
    
    `gem 'tinymce-rails', '>= 3.4.7.0.1'`

2. Install the gem:

    `bundle install`

3. Install the assets:

    `rails g spree_editor:install`

# Language-Support #
To obtain support for multiple languages with TinyMCE add tinymce-rails-langs to your Gemfile:

    `gem 'tinymce-rails-langs'`

TinyMCE will not be loaded unless it finds a language package matching your `Spree::Config.default_locale`.


*NOTE:* currently YUI Rich Editor is not yet 3.1 asset ready.
The only editors currently working on Spree 0.70.x are WYMEditor and TinyMCE.
